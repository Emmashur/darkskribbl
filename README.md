Dark Mode for Skribbl.io. Four dark backgrounds to choose from!

Update 27 Nov 2020: Fixed an issue that did not allow dark mode for private/custom games.

TO INSTALL: 
1) You must have the Tampermonkey extension (preferably on Chrome or Firefox).
2) Click on the darkmode.user.js file above, then click on "Raw" at the top right corner of the code. This will prompt you to install the script via Tampermonkey.
3) Profit!

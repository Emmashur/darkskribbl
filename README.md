Dark Mode for Skribbl.io. Four dark backgrounds to choose from!

TO INSTALL: 
1) You must have the Tampermonkey extension (preferably on Chrome or Firefox).
2) Click on the darkmode.user.js file above, then click on "Raw" at the top right corner of the code. This will prompt you to install the script via Tampermonkey.
3) Profit!

27 Nov 2020: Fixed an issue that did not allow dark mode for private/custom games.

05 Dec 2020: Added an adjustable dark layer over the canvas, so you don't have to stare at a bright white rectangle. **(Note: in Firefox this feature does not fully work as intended. To adjust the darkness you need to move your mouse away from the slider before releasing it.)**

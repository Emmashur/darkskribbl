Note for FireFox users: There is a glitch with the canvas darkness slider where it will snap back to the previous value. What you have to do to avoid this is 1) start dragging the slider like normal 2) move your mouse away from the slider while your mouse is still down, and 3) release your mouse, then click one more time somewhere on the page.

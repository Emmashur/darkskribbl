27 Nov 2020: Fixed an issue that did not allow dark mode for private/custom games.

05 Dec 2020: Added an adjustable dark layer over the canvas, so you don't have to stare at a bright white rectangle. **(Note: in Firefox this feature does not fully work as intended. To adjust the darkness you need to move your mouse away from the slider before releasing it.)**

13 Feb 2020: Added fading-in animation on loading page and fixed minor issues.

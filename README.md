27 Nov 2020: Fixed an issue that did not allow dark mode for private/custom games.

05 Dec 2020: Added an adjustable dark layer over the canvas, so you don't have to stare at a bright white rectangle all game.

13 Feb 2020: Added fading-in animation on loading page and fixed minor issues.

Disclaimer: This script saves your preferred background and canvas darkness, but does not access any other personal data.
